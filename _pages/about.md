I work as a data scientist at the BBC. I'm interested in applying machine learning to real problems. 

Previously, I worked as a consultant, then as a finance lead at a fast-growing charity. 
In 2021 I switched career, studying MSc Computer Science at UCL, graduating with a distinction. My dissertation using computer vision for energy forecasting was published as a <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/58">NeurIPS workshop paper</a>.

I work as a senior data scientist at the BBC. I’m interested in applying machine learning to real problems.

Before changing career to data science in 2021, I worked in finance and consulting. I graduated from MSc Computer Science at UCL with a distinction, and my dissertation was published as a NeurIPS workshop paper.

I’m most interested in NLP and ML engineering, and deploying solutions that work!

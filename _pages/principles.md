1. Purpose is everything. Projects need a clear business justification and need to be better than the counterfactual alternative. 

2. Complexity is cost. It's tempting to think that complex solutions are better, but they need to outweigh the cost (Thanks to Zexi for this one).

3. Create fast feedback cycles. Code tests and editors are great but still underutilised. They're motivating.  Get it shipped.

4. Be concise. People spend a lot of time typing and speaking but our ability to absorb information is limited. Write only what is needed.
